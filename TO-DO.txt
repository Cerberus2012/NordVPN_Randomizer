To-Do List:
  - Add option to allow users to specify specific server change time intervals versus random time intervals
  - Add option to allow users to specify if they want to only randomize within a certain country
  - Add a main menu
  - Add option for verbose output and logs
  - Change main function while loop to only check time at either 15 or 30 second time interval.  
        --> (Using continuous checks tends to put unnecessary strain on the CPU.)  
  - Put time into overall code cleanup
  
Continuous:
  - Fix any issues
